# Mario Battle Royale Redux
This is currently an incomplete clone of the game "Mario Battle Royale" created by Infernobro. This game uses Photon and Construct 2.

Note: This is currently extremely incomplete and is not even in a pre-alpha stage yet, so don't expect anything. All there is so far is very basic multiplayer functionality.

Requires Construct 2 and the Photon plugin to go along with it (included in this repository).
